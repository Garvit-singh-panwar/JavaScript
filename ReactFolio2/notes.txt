Use Effect hook :   
----------------        
----------------
                    it is used to manage all the side effects in our application

1. What is a "Side Effect"?
In React, a component has one main job: Render the UI.

The Main Task: Taking data (props/state) and turning it into HTML/JSX.

The Side Effect: Anything the component does besides rendering HTML. If the component reaches "outside" of itself to talk to the browser or a server, that is a side effect.
----------------------------------------------------------------
2. Common Examples
Fetching Data: Asking an external API for information.

Changing the Browser: Updating the document.title (the text on the tab).

Timers: Setting up a setTimeout or setInterval.

Event Listeners: Watching for a window resize or a scroll.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Think of a React component like a Chef in a kitchen.

The Chef’s main job is to cook a meal and put it on a plate (this is Rendering the UI). Anything the Chef does other than cooking that specific plate is a Side Effect.

👨‍🍳 Simple Definition
A Side Effect is any "extra work" a component does that reaches outside of its own "kitchen" (the component itself).

In React, we use the useEffect hook to handle these extra tasks safely so they don't get in the way of the cooking.

🌍 Best Real-Life Examples
1. The "Open/Close" Sign (Document Title)
Imagine you are inside a shop. When you walk in, the shopkeeper flips the sign on the outside of the door to say "Open."

The Component: The inside of the shop.

The Side Effect: Changing the sign on the outside door.

In React: Using useEffect to change the document.title (the text on the browser tab) when a user clicks a button.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. The Delivery Order (API Call)
You sit down at a restaurant. You look at the menu (UI). But the kitchen is out of fish! The waiter has to call the supplier to see if they can bring more.

The Component: Your table and menu.

The Side Effect: The phone call to the supplier (reaching out to an external server).

In React: Using useEffect to fetch a list of products from a database as soon as the page loads.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. The Security Guard (Event Listeners)
Imagine you hire a security guard to watch the front door. You tell him, "Tell me every time someone walks in."

The Component: Your house.

The Side Effect: The guard standing at the door watching the street.

In React: Using useEffect to "listen" to the window resizing or the user scrolling.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. The Library Book (Cleanup)
You go to a library and borrow a book. When you are done with the book, you must return it, or the library gets messy.

The Component: You reading the book.

The Side Effect: Borrowing the book from the shelf.

The Cleanup: Returning the book when you leave.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In React: If you start a timer or a music player in useEffect, you must "clear" or "stop" it when the component closes so it doesn't keep running in the background.

💡 Why do we need useEffect? (The "Repeat" Problem)
If a Chef had to call the supplier every single time he chopped a vegetable, he would never finish the meal.

In React, components "re-render" (re-chop) constantly. If you don't use useEffect, your component will try to call the API or change the title every single second, which crashes the app.

useEffect tells the Chef: "Finish the plate first, THEN make the phone call."

Summary in 3 Bullets:
Main Job: Showing stuff on the screen.

Side Effect: Doing anything outside the screen (API, Title, Timers).

useEffect: A "Scheduler" that makes sure these extra tasks happen at the right time.
