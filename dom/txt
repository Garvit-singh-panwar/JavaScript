This document summarizes the key takeaways, tools, frameworks, and insights presented in the Generative AI Workshop mentored by Vaibhav Sisinty.
🧠 The Power and Future of AI
Fun Fact!
99% of people think AI is only ChatGPT or Copilot.
This is a major concern, as AI is already 100x more powerful than most people realize.
The goal of the workshop is to show the true power of AI.
AI's Role (Current Perception vs. Reality)
Current Perception: AI is seen as your super smart assistant.
The Future: This won't be the case for long. AI is coming for all our jobs.
The AI Job Massacre Has Already Begun
The presentation highlights several reports and layoffs related to the rise of AI:
Prediction: The presenter predicts AI will take away at least 4 out of 5 jobs in the next few years, potentially within 2-3 years.
Layoff Examples:
Intel: Fired 15,000 employees while intensifying focus on AI.
Microsoft: Laid off 1,500 workers, blaming the "AI Wave".
Dell: Fired 12,500 employees to focus on AI.
Meta: Cut 600 jobs in the latest layoff; employees are now using AI to write performance reviews.
Corporate Giants (Amazon, UPS, Target): Announced layoffs totaling over 60,000 jobs cut this year.
AI Agent Outlook: Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) says AI agents, capable of complex tasks, will enter the workforce in 2025.
WEF Report: AI is projected to replace 85 million jobs by 2025.


How to Stay Relevant
The person who keeps their job will have to be a "10x person" who knows the way around AI better than others.
Jensen Huang (NVIDIA): "AI isn't coming to take your job. Someone using AI is coming to take your job". He advises that the first thing everyone should do is learn to use AI to augment their own productivity.
🗺️ AI For Yourself (AIY) Framework
The workshop introduces the AIY (AI For Yourself) framework to break down AI use cases into different buckets.
The five core buckets of the AIY framework are:
AI for core skills you need
AI for Your Productivity
AI for Your Learning
AI for Your Creativity
AI for Your Career

1. AI for Core Skills You Need (Mastering Prompt Engineering)
The foundation of using AI effectively is Mastering Prompt Engineering.
The Magic Prompt Formula consists of four key components:
Context
Task
Instruction
Example/Data


Example Prompt Breakdown: A good prompt uses a detailed structure, including setting the AI's persona (Context), defining the goal (Task), and adding specific requirements and style details (Instruction/Data).


Demo Use Case: Writing an email to 10k subscribers inviting them for the Generative AI workshop.


Tool Highlight: multi
This platform allows you to pose One Question to Every AI Model (Claude, GPT, Gemini) side by side to compare answers.



Tool Highlight: perplexity
Used as a "Research intern at your service".


Tool Highlight: Grok
Mentioned for "Social research using AI".

2. AI for Your Productivity (Work Smarter, Not Harder)
Challenge: 80% of people deal with Excel sheets every day, which consumes a lot of time.
Use Cases:
Using AI for Excel/Spreadsheets.
Building stunning data dashboards.
Tool Highlight: Claude

An AI tool that can build slides/presentations for you in minutes.

3. AI for Your Learning (Upgrade Your Brain with AI)
Goal: Learn and absorb things faster from the internet.
Use Cases: Summarize anything on the web and chat with it.
Tool Highlight: NotebookLM
An AI buddy to learn things quickly.

4. AI for Your Creativity (From idea to creation in seconds)
The focus is on creation with no design or code needed.
